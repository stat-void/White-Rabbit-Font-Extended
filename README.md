# White-Rabbit-Font-Extended
An updated version of the font that was originally created by Matthew Welch.

This is just a quick commit of a font that I have used quite often in my own projects. The original version only supported the basic ASCII set of letters, which started to slightly bugger me over time, so I decided to update it a little bit.

Some of the basic ASCII set of letters have been slightly modified for better readability/consistency, and the entire Extended ASCII table of letters has been added by me. I've also added some currency symbols (₤₩€₭₱₽).

If you just want to use the font, take the .otf file. If you want to edit it, the separate text file can be used in https://www.glyphrstudio.com/online/ to open it up with all the correct guides.

I might some day update this or write the readme more in-depth, but right now, eh.
